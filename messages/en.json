      "text": "Raphaël Jerusalmy is a French-Israeli writer.<br/><br/>Of Sephardic origin through his paternal grandmother, whose family members were for the most part exterminated at Auschwitz, he is also of Russian Ashkenazi heritage on his father’s side—an antiques dealer, craftsman, and bookbinder-gilder. After attending khâgne at Lycée Henri IV at age fifteen, he entered the École Normale Supérieure for Technical Education and the Sorbonne.<br/><br/>After his studies, he enlisted in the Israeli army, where he quickly moved into the intelligence service. Serving as a liaison officer—especially in Latin America—he met Augusto Pinochet and Yasser Arafat. After about fifteen years, he retired from the army and carried out educational and humanitarian work, then became a dealer in rare books in Tel Aviv. He is also a commentator on the I24news television channel.<br/><br/>He published his first highly acclaimed novel in 2012, “Sauvez Mozart,” for which he received the 2013 Emmanuel Roblès Prize and the ENS Cachan Literary Prize. The author of best-selling novels such as “La confrérie des chasseurs de livres” (Actes Sud, 2013) and “Denis Diderot, non à l’ignorance” (Actes Sud junior, 2014), his novel “Les obus jouaient à pigeon vole,” released in February 2016 in the Sur le fil collection by Éditions Bruno Doucey, was awarded the Readers’ Choice Prize at the Rendez-vous de l’histoire de Blois 2016. He won the 2017 Amerigo-Vespucci Prize for “Évacuation” (Actes Sud).<br/><br/>In 2018, he released “La rose de Saragosse,” a thrilling novel in which he revisits the persecution of Spain’s Jews by the Inquisition in the 15th century."

A dissonant realm to his ears as a music lover, an existential lapse in taste for this free spirit, a privileged and unwilling witness to the breakdown of a certain vision of humanity.<br/><br/>Everything seems decided, when an unexpected event brings him to the brink of altering the century. But if there was nothing left to save—except Mozart?<br/><br/>A debut novel fiercely subversive, driven by chilling wit, precise cruelty, and mischievous gravity."

A treacherous first step that will lead our poet, accompanied by his loyal accomplice Master Colin, into the most fantastical depths of the underworld of Jerusalem, amid a vast web of alliances, conspiracies, and counterplots..<br/><br/>As playful as he is scholarly, Jérusalmy brings to life a vivid and intrepid François Villon who champions the power of the mind over the might of dogma and arms, to see humanism and freedom prevail."

        "content": "<b>The most striking aspect of Israel’s response to the October 7, 2023 massacres is how its people preserved perfect self-control.</b><br/><br/>Despite the initial shock and the prolonged combat that followed, at no point did the population succumb to despair. They never mirrored the barbarism of their attackers, holding fast to their moral dignity even in those dark, harrowing weeks.<br/><br/>Jewish communities in Israel and the diaspora are reliving painful echoes of a past not so distant. Yet as the ugliness of antisemitism rears its head anew, the resilience with which the Jewish people face it is more admirable than ever. Outrageous statements from certain UN bodies, biased media outlets, or spiteful politicians crash again and again against the rock-solid perseverance of Jewish continuity. Hatred may rise and fall through the centuries, but Israel endures—and its spirit remains unbroken.<br/><br/>The staged theatrics of Hamas during hostage releases, the shameful pro-jihad rallies in free democracies, the spurious accusations, countless boycotts, and the intellectual slurs hurled by celebrities and establishments alike all ultimately disgrace their perpetrators. In contrast, the Jewish people emerge ennobled, strengthened, and proud to preserve their identity and self-respect amid the torrent of hatred.<br/><br/>Of course, Israelis suffer and mourn. Every day brings new names of soldiers killed or wounded, fresh missile alerts, and the agonizing task of explaining violence to young children without instilling terror. Yet each dawn, Israel confronts these challenges—and overcomes them. Though wounded in body and spirit, it refuses to yield an inch. Instead, it forges ahead: creating, inventing, and building—while many nations regress toward darker times.<br/><br/>This struggle demands constant vigilance over anger, resentment, and grief. It calls for immense inner strength to support our families, comfort the bereaved, and stand by the brave hostages and soldiers at the front. I am proud to stand among you. Thanks to your unwavering resilience, we have achieved the only victory that truly matters—the victory of integrity, determination, and tenacity that has sustained us through the ages."

This unwavering commitment to negotiation—even under the most trying international scrutiny—sent a clear message: no strategic objective justifies abandoning our own.<br/><br/>Critics decry concessions, but they miss the deeper victory: restoring hope to families held hostage, reaffirming national unity, and reminding the world that Israel’s core strength lies not only in its army, but in its compassion. Each successful release chip­ped away at Hamas’s leverage and bolstered Israel’s moral standing.<br/><br/>The repercussions extend beyond the immediate hostages. By choosing dialogue backed by decisive readiness for action, Israel sets a precedent for how democracies can respond to terror without sacrificing their soul. In the end, this moral triumph may yet prove more enduring than any territorial achievement."

In this explosive exposé, Raphaël Jerusalmy lays bare how the Palestinian Authority’s systematic mismanagement of waste and natural resources amounts to a form of ecological terrorism.<br/><br/>From the unchecked dumping of raw sewage into the Jordan Valley, to sprawling illegal landfills near delicate aquifers, the damage is both immediate and long-term. Nations that signed the Oslo Accords pledged to uphold environmental standards; instead, vast swathes of farmland and residential areas have been contaminated.<br/><br/>Worse still, the deliberate burning of tires and electronic refuse releases carcinogenic toxins into the air, threatening neighboring communities in both the West Bank and Israel. Years of neglect have transformed once-fertile valleys into blighted zones, forcing local populations to seek costly treatment for respiratory and water-borne diseases.<br/><br/>Jerusalmy calls on international bodies to enforce strict environmental oversight as part of any future agreements. Without accountability, this slow-motion assault on Mother Nature will escalate—eroding not only ecosystems, but the fragile foundations of peace itself."

Yet today, economic ruin and political paralysis threaten to pull the country into the abyss.\n\nHezbollah’s unchecked power, chronic corruption, and an outdated patronage system have hollowed out institutions. The once-bustling ports of Beirut now lie in ruins; power cuts and fuel shortages grip the population daily.\n\nIn this article, Raphaël Jerusalmy urges Western partners—most notably France and the United States—to seize the moment created by Lebanon’s recent maritime gas accord with Israel. By offering targeted financial aid tied to structural reforms, they can compel a recalibration of power away from militias and toward the state.\n\nTime is of the essence. Without swift, concerted action, Lebanon risks becoming a failed state—a haven for extremism that would destabilize the entire region. Preserving Lebanon’s Western affinity is not charity; it is strategic necessity."

In this reflective essay, Raphaël Jerusalmy examines the transformation of regional power balances.\n\nIsrael’s intelligence reconstruction has been swift and ruthless. New cyber-defense capabilities and revamped special-forces brigades now deter would-be aggressors. Yet at home, political infighting over security and judicial reforms continues to test national unity.\n\nAbroad, alliances have shifted: some Arab states, once reticent, now openly collaborate on security matters, while traditional partners press Israel to redouble diplomatic efforts. The lessons of the past year underscore a delicate equilibrium: military preparedness must be coupled with political acumen.\n\nLooking ahead to October 7, 2025, Jerusalmy argues that the region’s fate will hinge on whether leaders choose dialogue or division, reconstruction or retaliation—choices that will echo through generations."

Meanwhile, IoT devices—smart cameras in public spaces—feed into AI systems trained to detect antisemitic slogans on placards or graffiti.\n\nThese methods have already led to dozens of arrests, disrupting hate-networks before they can mobilize. Yet they raise thorny legal and ethical questions: How do we balance privacy rights against collective security? Who oversees the watchdogs?\n\nJerusalmy urges transparent oversight: parliamentary committees, independent auditors, and clear data-retention policies. If wielded responsibly, these technologies can turn the tide against hate; if misused, they risk undermining the very freedoms they aim to protect."

Joint exercises have honed rapid-response protocols along Europe’s southern flank.\n\nOn the technological front, systems like the Iron Dome and Arrow-3 have been demoed to European defense ministers, sparking interest in co-production and joint procurement. These shields do not merely defend Israeli skies—they offer a model for protecting major European capitals.\n\nJerusalmy concludes that lifting arms-embargos and deepening collaboration is not controversial—it is pragmatic. By standing with Israel, Europe fortifies its own security architecture against the dangers of tomorrow."

He recounts conversations with survivors whose experiences—though unspeakable—demand to be told.\n\nThrough carefully crafted characters, the novel bridges past and present, showing how the echoes of the Shoah ripple through today’s world. Jerusalmy argues that only by engaging the imagination can we guard against collective amnesia.\n\nListeners learn about his research process—archival visits, survivor testimonies, and the alchemy of blending fact with narrative empathy. The interview closes on a hopeful note: that art, in its most honest form, can spark both remembrance and renewal."
